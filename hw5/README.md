# Submission Information
Here is a summary of what I have done in each part
## Part a
In part a I followed the colab that was shared. I added my own EDA's such as a heatmap to find correlations between features. It would show similarities between two features that should be used in the model. I added a couple other smaller ones as well checking for duplicates. Obviously there were none but it was nice to check nonetheless.

# Part b
You will see two attempts for this. This is because I was silly and didn't notice that the TFX version of part a was in the comments section of the slides. In the first one you can see my attempting to create the TFX for it from scratch or trying to just add the model from part a and see if that would work. This obviously doesn't work because for TFX you have to start from part 1 and setup everything properly for your data and model. 

I then looked at the second link, which had all this. I followed the guide for this one and was able to complete this successfully. TFX from scratch is essentially a project in itself :)

# Part c
This was far by the more annoying part of the assignment. As I have an ARM processor on my machine, I could not run some of the python scripts on my local machine to setup my training data. I was able to do this after a bit of back and forth between two different computers. I was able to follow and complete this as well.

# Part d
This was really easy once I had setup myself for the previous assignment. I was able to resuse the same data. Though my results were slightly off as I had far less training data (uploading the whole dataset would in itself take a couple days, had to use the sample). Regardless, the charts during the EDA were pretty similar to the original using the training. Though there are later steps, which are useless on the training data I had, that were off.

# Conclusion
Overall this was a good assignment. Felt a little like copy and paste with a couple changes here and there. Maybe in the future this can be just 1 part which you need to attempt TFX yourself on a simple data and model.
