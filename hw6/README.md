# Submission Information

## Part a
I was able to implement the same code from the website (https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/). Except I ran this on the MINST dataset. For some reason my model was not improving on each iteration. I think my model was setup incorrectly. At the very least I was able to load in the MINST data set and try a model. There are unit tests as well.

## Part b
I was able to do an image classification on dog breeds for part a. I was able to load the data and apply all the cells from the original code. I don't think the original model from the website will work on this dataset, which is why I have low accuracy.

I was able to implement the same code from the website (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html). This was on the Cifar10 dataset.

## Conclusion
This was a fun assignment, I wish the focus was just on part a so we could tinker around with the model. With the number of parts and time,  I had to overlook the accuracy and move to the next parts. I think my models were not configured properly which caused the issues.
