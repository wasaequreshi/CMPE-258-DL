# Submission Information

## Part a

This is the code that I followed: https://github.com/lmoroney/tfbook/tree/master/chapter18/RockPaperScissors

It was a copy and paste exercise but instead I commented the code and looked up what each part of the code meant to get a better understanding of how this was done. The webcam.js and retrain.html I left with no comments. The webcam.js was provided and the HTML didn't need any obvious comments.

Also this is a functioning app. I was able to open the retrain.html file and test this out. I only added 3 images of me doing rock, paper, and scissors. It was able to accurately identify what I was choosing.

## Part b

This was also using this guide: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/snapshot-keras/site/en/guide/keras/rnn.ipynb#scrollTo=a5617759e54e

I read through the article and followed the steps. Reading the colab is not enough however, side reading is needed to understand the different RNN models.

## Part c

This was also using this guide: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/recognize-flowers-with-tensorflow-on-android#0

I read through the article and followed the steps. I ran the colab to get the tflite model (added that as well.) I then made the respective changes in the MainActivity.kt file. I was not able to run this on my machine however. But I followed the steps and theoretically this should work on your machine upon running :)
